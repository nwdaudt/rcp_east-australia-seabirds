# Seabird assemblages are linked to the major western boundary current off eastern Australia

This `.scripts/README` guide you through the scripts used in [XXXXX et al. (*in review*) -- *#citation link*]

There will be two sessions. Jump straight in [*modelling* -- *#session link*] if you are interested in the paper results. The [*whole pipeline* -- *#session link*] explains the logic behind each script and what it does.

***
## General workflow and formatation

The scripts are named following a numerical order, so that is easy to follow.

![Fig 1. Scripts workflow](https://github.com/nwdaudt/rcp_east-australia-seabirds/blob/main/scripts/scripts-workflow.png)

All scripts were developed using [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) and, for the sake of facility, I structured them into 'code sections'. So, if you use RStudio, you can follow the *document outline* easily. 

Below, under each heading, I discriminate the code sections and, if needed, added some info.
