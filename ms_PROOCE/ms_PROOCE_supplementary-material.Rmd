The number of groups with the lowest BIC value indicates the best number of groups (assemblages) that describes the data.

The resulting plot also shows how many groups were 'empty' (colour scale) with 'five or less' or 'only one' sites assigned to an RCP, i.e. the model was fit with, say, 5 groups, but 3 of them had 'five or less' or 'only one' sites (grids) allocated to an RCP.](../results/FigS3_1_multifit-Bernoulli.png){width="100%"}
